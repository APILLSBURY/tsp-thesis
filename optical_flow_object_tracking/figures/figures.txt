Figures:
1.1) forward flow with mask
1.2) backward flow with mask
1.3) final flow with intersection

2.1) separated areas of mask
2.2) expanded mask
2.3) mask with bad thetas removed
2.4) too scattered mask???

3.1) before move: overlap mask, venn diagram style (with arrow in direction of theta)
3.2) after move: overlap mask, venn diagram style

4.1) object frame1
4.2) object frame3
4.3) interpolated object frame2

5.1) venn diagram of object frame1 overlap, object frame2, object frame3 overlap
5.2) intermediate masks of above mask

6) final images
